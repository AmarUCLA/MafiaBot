# MafiaBot
This is a bot for mafia in rocket league (or probably anything else)!

Commands: $mafiajoin -> join the mafia queue.
          $mafialeave -> leave the mafia queue.
          
          
By default the max mafia size is set to 6, but you can change that in the playerLimit constant in index.js (must be greater than 1!)

To run:

npm install discord.js

then afterwards simply add your Discord Bot API key, along with the channel id in which you want the bot to respond to, in the config.json file.

Happy Mafia'ing!
